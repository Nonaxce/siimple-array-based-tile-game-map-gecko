# siimple-array-based-tile-game-map-gecko
 A game that functions on the use of 2d arrays in javascript

The game's logic is based on a 9 x 9 2d array which loops through the items 
with a for loop and then generates a patterned grid that appears on the DOM

Each time the array gets updated, a that draws the elements 
will execute showing the updated map.

Clicking the "add player" button will replace an empty space or "0" to a "1" in the array 
for the draw() function to update and show the player
